# SGM Odds

The output of the `data_processing/loot.py` script of my [SGM Processor](https://github.com/Krazete/sgmprocessor) repository.

Folder `X-Y-Z` indicates game version `X.Y.Z`. The text files within each folder contain information related to event rewards, relic drop rates, and other loot chances of that game version.
